/**
 * Auto-register the CRUD + workflow abilities contributed by a collection.
 *
 * Every registered collection contributes exactly six abilities, all in
 * the `collections.<path>` group:
 *
 *   - `collections.<path>.read`          — enumerate / fetch documents
 *   - `collections.<path>.create`        — create new documents
 *   - `collections.<path>.update`        — modify existing documents
 *   - `collections.<path>.delete`        — delete documents (soft or hard)
 *   - `collections.<path>.publish`       — transition a document into the
 *                                          `published` status
 *   - `collections.<path>.changeStatus`  — any other workflow transition
 *                                          (draft → custom state, etc.)
 *
 * Registration is unconditional: every collection in Byline has a workflow
 * (the default `draft → published → archived` one when not explicitly
 * configured), so `publish` and `changeStatus` always apply. Keeping the
 * six-ability contract uniform makes the role editor UI predictable and
 * avoids hidden conditional logic downstream.
 *
 * Called from `initBylineCore()` for each declared collection. See
 * docs/analysis/AUTHN-AUTHZ-ANALYSIS.md §3 and Phase 1.
