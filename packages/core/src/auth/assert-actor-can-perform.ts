/**
 * Central enforcement helper. Called from the service layer — at the top
 * of each `document-lifecycle` function and at the top of each
 * `@byline/client.CollectionHandle` read method — before any DB work.
 *
 * Policy, in order:
 *
 *   1. **No `RequestContext`** → `ERR_UNAUTHENTICATED`. Every enforced
 *      call site must supply a context. Tests, seeds, and migration
 *      scripts pass `createSuperAdminContext()` from `@byline/auth` for
 *      this.
 *
 *   2. **`actor === null` (public / anonymous reader)**:
 *        - Only permitted on `verb === 'read'`.
 *        - Only when `readMode === 'published'` (the `@byline/client`
 *          default for unauthenticated consumers).
 *        - Any other combination → `ERR_UNAUTHENTICATED`.
 *
 *   3. **Actor present** → `actor.assertAbility('collections.<path>.<verb>')`.
 *      `AdminAuth` with `isSuperAdmin: true` short-circuits the check
 *      internally; any other actor must hold the specific ability.
 *
 * Direct adapter calls (`db.commands.*` / `db.queries.*`) intentionally
 * bypass this helper — the same escape hatch that skips collection
 * hooks. Seeds, migrations, and internal tooling live there.
 *
 * See docs/AUTHN-AUTHZ.md.
