/**
 * Request-scoped context threaded through every admin server fn,
 * `document-lifecycle` service, `IDocumentQueries` method, `@byline/client`
 * entry point, and collection hook.
 *
 * The auth subsystem populates `actor`; downstream code reads it. Today
 * the threading is plumbing only — `actor.assertAbility(...)` is not yet
 * called at the `document-lifecycle` / `IDocumentQueries` boundary. See
 * the Phase status table in AUTHN-AUTHZ-ANALYSIS.md.
 *
 * `RequestContext` is intentionally independent of the existing
 * `ReadContext` (populate / `afterRead` recursion guard) for now. Merging
 * them is a potential follow-up if it earns its keep; keeping them
 * separate in Phase 0 avoids churning every populate call site.
 *
 * Fields:
 *   - `actor`        — the authenticated identity (or `null` for public
 *                      read paths). Service-layer enforcement (when wired)
 *                      will permit `null` only when
 *                      `readMode === 'published'`.
 *   - `requestId`    — monotonic-ish UUIDv7 per logical request. Surfaces
 *                      in log lines and error cause chains.
 *   - `locale`       — optional content locale for this request. When
 *                      omitted, callers fall back to the default locale
 *                      from `ServerConfig.i18n.content.defaultLocale`.
 *   - `readMode`     — `'any'` (admin default) or `'published'` (public
 *                      default). Mirrors the existing `ReadMode` on
 *                      `IDocumentQueries` call options; threaded here so
 *                      the auth layer can reason about the public-read
 *                      case uniformly.
