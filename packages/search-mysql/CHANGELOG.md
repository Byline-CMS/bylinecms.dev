# @byline/search-mysql

## 4.10.2

### Patch Changes

- fixed a fresh install failing to hydrate: use-sync-external-store is now installed as a host dependency, and `@byline/i18n/react` is pre-bundled so one <I18nProvider> instance serves the whole admin
  fixed `byline init` reporting an already-merged `vite.config.ts` as complete instead of bringing Byline-owned settings up to date
- Updated dependencies
  - @byline/core@4.10.2
  - @byline/search-analysis@4.10.2

## 4.10.1

### Patch Changes

- fixed `byline init` leaving a fresh TanStack Start app unable to boot, by merging Byline's required Vite settings into an existing `vite.config.ts`
  fixed scaffolded seed and import scripts hanging instead of exiting once their work committed
- Updated dependencies
  - @byline/core@4.10.1
  - @byline/search-analysis@4.10.1

## 4.10.0

### Minor Changes

- added MySQL as a first-class `byline init` / `byline setup` database choice, with per-adapter squashed baselines refused on any occupied database
  pinned `@byline/db-*` exactly to the CLI release carrying its baseline

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @byline/core@4.10.0
  - @byline/search-analysis@4.10.0

## 4.9.0

### Minor Changes

- added portable multilingual search analysis with built-in PostgreSQL and MySQL full-text providers, shared provider conformance, and original-text highlighted snippets
  hardened query analysis against quadratic identifier scanning and preserved SKU/version constituent recall
- 78726f3: Added the built-in MySQL full-text `SearchProvider`, backed by portable
  multilingual analysis, weighted MySQL `FULLTEXT` indexes, driver-owned
  migrations, analyzer-fingerprint enforcement, and the shared provider
  conformance suite. Ranked hits include portable highlighted snippets from the
  stored original body text.

  Documented and wired `@byline/db-mysql` installations to use the real search
  provider instead of a no-op workaround. Fingerprint checks use collection
  metadata rather than scanning indexed documents, and phrase translation now
  emits only the source and expansion-kind variants represented by physical
  matching streams.
