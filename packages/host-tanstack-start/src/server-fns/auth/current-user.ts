/**
 * Admin profile lookup for the authenticated request.
 *
 * Thin wrapper that resolves the `AdminAuth` via `getAdminRequestContext()`
 * (which handles verify + lazy refresh + cookie rewrites), then fetches the
 * admin user's profile row so the UI can render "signed in as X" without
 * embedding identity metadata in the JWT itself.
 *
 * Throws `ERR_UNAUTHENTICATED` through `getAdminRequestContext` when there
 * is no valid session — callers treat that as "redirect to sign-in".
